I've been working on many different projects, from social startups to medical and financial systems for international companies and teams that came in all shapes and sizes (from being single mobile dev in a project to being part of a huge teams distributed in multiple countries around the world). Currently I'm into Android development and I would like to follow this path in the future.\n\nLately, I found great interest in learning Kotlin (both for Android and Spring purposes) and I've tried to tackle with full blown test driven development for Android.\n\nYou can find me on:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelraciborski\n- GitHub: https://github.com/Majfrendmartin\n\nInterests: IT news, music, sci-fi and fantasy books, history, photography, computer games."
